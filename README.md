# Online-Hotel-Booking-System
The project “Online Hotel Booking System” is a system based on accessing the internet to book rooms in a hotel. The purpose of this study is to develop and implement an online hotel reservation system for hotels that will replace the manual method of booking hotel rooms.


The purpose of this mini project is to enable customers to make reservations for our hotel online. When the customer visits the website, he/she can view the pictures of the hotel in the gallery section. Details of the rooms and tariff per night is provided. If the customer wants to make a reservation they need to sign up by entering their details like name, phone number, mail id. The customer can then reserve a room by entering details like check in and check out date, number of rooms and number of members. Reservations can be made for dining as well. For both these reservations, a receipt will be issued. Details about the hotel are provided or customer service. The customer can also provide feedback about our hotel.
